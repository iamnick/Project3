<p>I kind of stuck with my theme of summer vacation this week, detailing a trip to a restaurant named Cap'n Jack's that we would always visit each year. The way I ended up coding this story isn't in a way that's really unique to me, but more of a generic trip to a restaurant. For the object, restaurant, I did use specific details for Cap'n Jack's though.</p>
